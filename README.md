Project Re: Al is a mix of a visual novel and a point-and-click adventure game. Players navigate the map and interact with objects in the game by clicking on the navigate and interact buttons and trigger cutscenes to obtain notes and advance the game. 
Each cutscene provides more insight into the game world and the storyline. At the end, players will be forced to make a choice that will decide the ending they will obtain for the game.

Disclaimer:

The design of the game such as the character and background sprites are heavily inspired by 1BitHeart, which is described as "an adventure game where you make friends" (https://store.steampowered.com/app/618720/1bitHeart/).

All the character sprites have been traced from existing characters from 1BitHeart with some changes to the design and color palette. Hence, none of the character sprites belong to me.
All background sprites have been originally designed with Inkscape, which style is also heavily inspired by 1BitHeart. Some components of the background are images of icons found on Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/).
All of the background themes have been sourced from YouTube and all the sound effects have been sourced from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/). Hence, they do not belong to me as well.

The story of the game has been inspired by both 1BitHeart and Persona 5 Royal.
